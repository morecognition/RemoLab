# Remorder.
## Introduction.
This application allows the user to connect the Remo device with an Android device, start a data transmission, visualise the data on a cartesian chart and optionally store the recorded data in the local filesystem.
The application was built using [Dart & Flutter](https://flutter.dev/) and using the BLoCs pattern via the [bloc library](https://bloclibrary.dev/#/). It could potentially be deployed on all platforms supported by Flutter, however it is currently constrained by its Bluetooth usage provided by the [flutter_bluetooth_serial library](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_bluetooth_serial), which currently only supports Android.
## Roadmap.
You can find the planned and under development list of features [here](https://gitlab.com/morecognition/remorder/-/boards).
## Installing the application.
The application is publicly available [on the Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.morecognition.remolab_flutter)
The application is also available for internal and closed tests, if you've been invited into one of these 2 channels, you can accept the invitation at one one of these links to try the development or beta version:

## Building the application from source.
After [setting up your environment](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install) you can test the application by simply writing `flutter run` on the console or you can build it by writing `flutter build apk` (more about this [here](https://flutter.dev/docs/deployment/android)). The master branch is updated with the latest development version, previous versions can be found [here](https://gitlab.com/morecognition/remorder/-/releases).
